# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement
Haiming Wang, as an EDGE Architectural Technologies graduate student, needs a professional online presence that effectively communicates their unique intersection of computational design, AI, and neuroscience in architecture. Generic portfolio templates don't capture the sophisticated, multidisciplinary nature of their work.

### Core Problems Solved
1. **Professional Identity**: Establishes credibility in the competitive architectural technology field
2. **Work Visibility**: Makes complex computational/AI architectural projects accessible to diverse audiences
3. **Career Positioning**: Positions Haiming for opportunities in both Los Angeles and Shanghai markets
4. **Technical Demonstration**: Shows both design sensibility and technical implementation skills

## How It Should Work

### User Experience Goals
- **Immediate Impact**: Visitors understand Haiming's expertise within seconds
- **Visual Storytelling**: Projects communicate complexity without overwhelming
- **Professional Credibility**: Clean, sophisticated presentation builds trust
- **Easy Exploration**: Intuitive navigation encourages deeper engagement

### Key User Journeys
1. **Potential Employer**: Bio → Projects → Skills → Contact
2. **Academic Collaborator**: Projects → Technical interests → Bio → Contact  
3. **Client/Consultant**: Projects → Capabilities → Contact
4. **Peer/Student**: Technical interests → Projects → Bio

### Experience Principles
