```

## 🚀 MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH - Latest Session

### Problem Solved: MIME Type Errors
- **Issue**: JavaScript modules failing to load with "application/octet-stream" error
- **Root Cause**: Netlify serving JS files with wrong Content-Type
- **Solution**: Added netlify.toml and _headers configuration files
- **Result**: ✅ All JavaScript modules now loading correctly

### Problem Solved: Vite Asset Paths
- **Issue**: Images showing broken/404 errors  
- **Root Cause**: Using `./images/` instead of `/images/` for public folder assets
- **Solution**: Updated Projects.jsx to use absolute paths for Vite public folder
- **Result**: ✅ All images and videos now display perfectly

### Configuration Files Added
1. **netlify.toml**: Sets proper Content-Type headers and build settings
2. **public/_headers**: Backup MIME type configuration
3. **Updated CSP**: Added `img-src 'self' data:` for favicon support

## 📱 Portfolio Content - LIVE

### Working Components
- **Header**: Haiming Wang, Los Angeles/Shanghai location
- **Bio Section**: AI & architectural technologies focus
- **Projects Carousel**: 5 items with working navigation
  - 4 GIF animations showing architectural work
  - 1 MP4 video demonstration
  - Left/right arrow navigation
  - Smooth CSS transitions
- **Skills Grid**: Three-column interests/tools layout
- **Footer**: Contact email with dynamic year

### Technical Features Working
- **React State Management**: useState for carousel navigation
- **Responsive Design**: CSS media queries for mobile/desktop
- **Google Fonts**: Space Grotesk typography loading
- **Asset Loading**: All public folder resources accessible
- **Hot Reload**: Development workflow fully functional

## 🔧 Development Environment - OPTIMIZED

### Local Development
- **Server**: `npm run dev` → http://localhost:5174/
- **Build**: `npm run build` → generates optimized dist/
- **Preview**: `npm run preview` → test production build locally
- **Hot Reload**: ✅ Working perfectly

### Production Deployment
- **Platform**: Netlify (willowy-blini-fc737f.netlify.app)
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Publish Directory**: `dist`
- **Status**: ✅ Live and error-free

## 🎯 Key Learnings from Troubleshooting

### Vite-Specific Knowledge Gained
1. **Public Folder Assets**: Must use `/images/file.jpg` not `./images/file.jpg`
2. **MIME Types**: Hosting platforms may need explicit Content-Type configuration
3. **Base Paths**: Vite `base: './'` works for most deployment scenarios
4. **CSP Headers**: Need `img-src 'self' data:` for favicon data URIs

### Netlify Deployment Best Practices
1. **netlify.toml**: Essential for proper JavaScript module serving
2. **_headers**: Backup configuration for Content-Type issues
3. **Build Settings**: Match npm scripts for consistency
4. **Redirect Rules**: SPA support with catch-all routing
