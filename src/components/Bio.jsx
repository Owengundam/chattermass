      <h2>Revolutionary AI-Driven Design</h2>
      <p className="bio">
        ChatterMass is a revolutionary AI-driven architectural design tool that combines conversational AI 
        with Unity-based ML-Agents for spatial optimization. The platform enables architects to use natural 
        language commands to manipulate and optimize architectural massing, fundamentally changing how buildings 
        are designed and iterated. With MVRDV expressing interest in both the technology and the developer, 
        ChatterMass represents a significant commercial opportunity in the computational design space, 
        positioned to become the industry standard for AI-assisted architectural massing and spatial 
        program optimization.
